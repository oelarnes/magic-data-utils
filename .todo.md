* rewrite draft_data.py using polars
    * metrics(groupbys=['name'], columns=(default_columns (configured)):
        * expand dependencies
        * organize by view
        * validate groupbys: if metrics for both views, then all groupbys are both views
        * call counts functions with groupbys and view columns
    * counts functions (internal)
        * take valid groupbys and columns
        * validate anyway
        * extend df in passes
        * register finished columns 
* Caching
* Seen counts
* Picked counts
* Rate metrics
